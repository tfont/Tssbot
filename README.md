Tssbot v 0.1
======

Installation instructions can be found at nowhere! Because I'm lazy to write that shit >:3 

It depends purely on PHP and MySQL and constantly runs on the server once the script is called through the browser, no outside additional PHP extensions are required besides what is already provided in an initial PHP installation.

ENJOY! And code away :D

Tssbot is GPLv2.
